# Heart-Sound-Classification-from-ECG-Signal-s-Using-Machine-Learning

Classified normal and abnormal heart sounds by exploring and processing data using statistic and machine learning toolbox, wavelet toolbox, and signal processing toolbox.
Developed a predictive model and integrate analytic by training ECG dataset in different machine learning like Fine tree, Logistic regression, and KNN classifier etc.
